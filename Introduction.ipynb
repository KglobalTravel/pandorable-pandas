    "## A familiar story\n",

    "Part of writing pandorable code is readability. We want your data analysis pipelines to flow clearly from step to step. To illustrate this, let's retell a story from [Jeff Allen's](http://trestletech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dplyr.pdf) presentation on dplyr:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tumble_after(\n",
    "    broke(\n",
    "        fell_down(\n",
    "            fetch(\n",
    "                went_up(jack_jill, \"hill\"),\n",
    "                \"water\"),\n",
    "            jack),\n",
    "        \"crown\"),\n",
    "    \"jill\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably recognized this as the story of *Jack and Jill*. But it may not have been immediately obvious, when told \"inside-out\" like that. Data analysis pipelines take raw data and transform them somehow into a useful result by applying a series of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In English, we read left-to-right, top-to-bottom; not inside out. Let's rewrite the story, using *method chaining*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "story = (\n",
    "    jack_jill\n",
    "        .went_up(\"hill\")\n",
    "        .fetch(\"water\")\n",
    "        .fell_down(\"jack\")\n",
    "        .broke(\"crown\")\n",
    "        .tumble_after(\"jill\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This story, told two ways, illustrates a couple interesting points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions / methods are typically *verbs* (`went_up`, `fetch`, etc.).\n",
    "2. Function arguments are typically *nouns* (`jack`, `\"crown\"`, etc.).\n",
    "3. For readability, it's helpful to have the *structure of your code* reflect the data flow through the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see a lot of method chaining today. It's best used in moderation.\n",
    "\n",
